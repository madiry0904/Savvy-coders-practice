/*
 ** if you want to return an object use function constructors
 ** if want to return function use function factory
 ** JS  is a prototype OOP while other languages are class based OOP languages
 ** getter and setter are basically functions to "protect" the data
    ** setter is something where we have a method that will manipulate the data
        if you want to change someones last name without going in you create a method to change


  ** must use the "new" keyword for a function constructor because it actually returns out an instance of an object
      ** const me = new Person ('Manav', 'Misra, 23);
