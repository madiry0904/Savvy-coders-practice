      '<p>Aaron’s first glimpse into the world of audio production came during his high school band practices in the 90’s when they recorded themselves for reference and, later, for early social media websites - think Myspace and Napster. But as the oldest child with access to the family video camera it was actually in the late 80’s when Aaron first began playing with video production experimenting with perspective illusions, stop and start techniques and sound effects in homemade videos with siblings and friends. The fun he had as a kid got serious in college when a Practicum in Radio class at UMSL introduced him to the professional world of radio and audio production - right here at 90.7 KWMU.</p><p>“It really is exciting” he says talking about the energy of live radio “...it’s like an airplane taking off. You feel all this energy here [in the studio] with all these people running around and figuring things out and you’ve just done mic checks and you’re monitoring air control for the handoff and then you hit the button and give a big [here Aaron raises his hand and with a flourish points forward with a loud whooshing noise]... it’s just fun.” In 2001 Aaron changed his academic focus from art to audio and earned an audio engineering degree from Webster University. Having returned to KWMU to for an internship requirement his graduating year he was hired as part time production assistant in 2004.</p><p><strong>A typical shift of St. Louis On The Air</strong> sees Aaron, usually working alongside an intern (full circle moment) positioning microphones, cueing the start of the show, balancing audio levels, playing music breaks, airing call-ins, and fading in theme music. And there really are a lot of people in the room: there’s two or three producers monitoring show content, social media engagement, potential podcast excerpts. There’s a call screener too and when the room gets noisy Aaron puts on a (very nice pair of) headphones and zeros in.<br><strong>Post production duties</strong> include editing the show and recording re-takes for the re-air if necessary, recording and uploading promos for the next day’s show, and separating the program into segments for the podcast.<br><strong>Show inside jokes</strong> include yelling “Hit the dump!” when anyone on the air says something that could be construed as vulgar, and “Cue [song name]” when anyone on the air mentions something (even remotely) related to a famous song.</p><p>Aaron <a href="https://www.aarondoerr.com/" target="_blank">teaches guitar and bass guitar full time</a> from his home studio in the Lindenwood Park neighborhood of south St. Louis city where he also hosts jam sessions for his adult students, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aarontrio/videos" target="_blank">live streams improvisational music over NASA tv on twitch</a>, and maintains a growing collection of audio equipment.

      "<p>Shelley Kerley leads St. Louis Public Radio&rsquo;s fundraising team to raise money from individuals and foundations. She firmly believes that public radio has the most interesting, generous and dedicated donors and loves meeting them and helping them support what they care most about at STLPR. Donors who share their stories about how STLPR touches their lives are constant inspiration. An avid gardener, traveler, hiker and camper, she lives in Illinois and finds an unending supply of new book recommendations from NPR and STLPR to feed her reading addiction. In her decades of fundraising work at STLPR, she&rsquo;s directed numerous fundraising projects and actually enjoys getting to be on the air during the member campaigns. She holds a BA in music education (and stills sneaks in some time to play the violin and piano) from Western Illinois University as well as an MBA from the same institution.</p>"

      "<p>Zeke was born and raised in North County, recently moved to University City, and they are in love. They moved to U City for its proximity to Forest Park &ndash; the jewel of our city. There are many beautiful cities within our country to make a home, but St. Louis has always been Zeke&rsquo;s. A musician, Zeke thinks our music and arts scene is a step ahead of most surrounding areas, with a focus on promoting local and emerging talent. From the inclusivity of The Grove, the timeless beauty of Forest Park, to our very own 90.7 St. Louis Public Radio, St. Louisan&rsquo;s have a lot to be proud of.</p><p>At St. Louis Public Radio, Zeke works with the membership team to raise funds and assist with event planning for the station. Both of these activities are extremely fulfilling and exciting. They love that they get to speak daily to our members and work closely with volunteers. Events are opportunities for Zeke to share in the love of public radio and familiarize themself with listeners.</p><p>The station&rsquo;s ongoing success is important to Zeke because St. Louis Public Radio is a staple in our community. It is a source that thousands depend on for reliable information &ndash; including Zeke and their family. They grew up, like many young people, listening to NPR in the backseat of their mom&rsquo;s van on the way to school. Their mother was a teacher and taught Zeke that Public Radio is an unbiased source of news and information. Zeke admits that at age 7, they might not have soaked that message in entirely, but as they grew in years, they started questioning the world for themself. In St. Louis Public Radio, they and their mother, like thousands of supporting members, found reliability and a deep understanding of the community.</p><p>When Zeke&rsquo;s not at the station, you can find them with headphones in, behind their drum kit, or poring over a mixing board. Music has been a part of their life since day one. Their parents were both music educators, so, as they always likes to say, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t stand a chance.&rdquo; They did their time as a marching band &ldquo;geek&rdquo; and loved every minute of it. Later on, they started writing and performing in local groups. You&rsquo;d have seen them most recently with St. Louis&rsquo;s own Middle Class Fashion. Thier current passion is recording, mixing, and producing original music. In the future, they would love to record emerging area musicians in an effort to continue growing the St. Louis music community.</p>"
